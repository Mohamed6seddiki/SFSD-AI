# SFSD-AI

An AI-powered educational platform for teaching and visualizing File & Data Structures (SFSD) concepts. This project combines modern web technologies with artificial intelligence to help computer science students better understand fundamental data structures and file organization algorithms.

## 📚 About

SFSD stands for "Structures de Fichiers et Structures de Données" (File & Data Structures in French). This platform provides an interactive learning environment that leverages AI to:

- Visualize complex data structures and file operations
- Provide intelligent tutoring and explanations
- Generate practice problems and exercises
- Offer personalized learning paths based on student progress

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic representations of data structures in action
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Get intelligent explanations and help with algorithms
- **Educational Content**: Comprehensive lectures and tutorials on SFSD topics
- **Practice Mode**: Hands-on exercises with real-time feedback
- **Modern Web Interface**: Responsive and intuitive user experience

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Python
- AI/ML frameworks for intelligent tutoring

**Frontend:**
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

**Content:**
- Curated lectures and educational materials

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed6seddiki/SFSD-AI.git
cd SFSD-AI
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

### 3. Data Setup

Ensure the lecture materials in the `data/lectures` directory are properly configured.

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python app.py  # or the main application file
```

### Starting the Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser or serve it using a local server:

```bash
cd frontend
# Using Python's built-in server
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
